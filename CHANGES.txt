•A single wrapper can run from /Applications for any user on the machine. Updated 2.0 to 2.1 wrappers may have issues still, you may want to make a new wrapper.
•Wineskin.app has a new commands blank where you can enter custom commands (like setting variables) that will run along with Wine.
•Engines changes should no longer prompt about Gecko

•Wineskin ICE (Installable Compressed Engine) support added in, and a single first ICE engine is released (WS7Wine1.2.2ICE).

This is useful if you have many wrappers that all can use the same ICE version, as it will end up saving a lot of hard drive space.

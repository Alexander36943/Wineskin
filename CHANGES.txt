Release numbers go by wrapper versions as they are the main thing updated covering everything but Winery, which should not be updated very often.
Release 2.5.4 - in Beta
• updated WineskinX11 to xorg-server 1.11.99.902+patches
• updated all supporting libraries to most current
• File Associations should work correctly
• Various error detection and handling improvements
• Fixes to detecting where fonts are on system X11
• Uses newest version quartz-wm on your system, unless its not found, then uses wrapper version.  This fixes many problems with decorated windows.
• WineskinQuitScript script added in Menu Script folder to do a CMD+Q shutdown.  Lets software makers have a chance to put in commands and such to do before someone can just kill it with CMD+Q.
• CD Eject command added to top menubar by default.  Can help getting discs switched right for multi-disc game installs.
• If you launch a wrapper that a different user is already using, it no longer causes problems, it just gives an error that it cannot be used by multiple users at the same time.
• Default settings changed for copy/paste so it should work more reliably
• Experimental WineskinLauncher using AppleScript added to git.  Its for work in testing how to find a way to get wrappers running on read-only volumes eventually, but is not in use.
• Default Menu scripts have info on them on how to access and use Wine correctly, so you can launch other programs in Wine or whatever is needed.
-Known Issue
• Prompt on quit option will NOT work unless you delete the WineskinQuitScript

Release 2.5.3 - Released November 4, 2011
• Decorated windows should allow click through and focus follows mouse

Release 2.5.2 - Released October 18, 2011
• symlink .Xmodmap so it'll work
• set libGL back to Mesa 7.8 for now since its not so crashy on many titles

Release 2.5.1 - Released October 8, 2011
• cabextract set to executable

Release 2.5 - Released October 7, 2011
• Wineskin internal user folders should always use English words now, so folder linking and such will always work on any language/locale and when ports/wrappers change between languages/locales.  Older wrappers may not update 100% right, and require a 'Rebuild Wrapper' to take advantage of this.
• Wineskin wrappers will no longer prevent other users from using Wineskin wrappers on the system.  If a pre-2.5 one was run, it will still break them running for other users until you reboot, or remove the /tmp/Wineskin symlink.
• Custom Commands now run after setting of main variables like wineprefix.
• Command Line Shell button added to Wineskin.app to get a command prompt for running any tools you need, like regsrv32
• Wineskin will clean up a bit better after WineskinX11, to prevent problems with crashes when running Xquartz later.  If Xquartz crashes after a Wineskin wrapper has run, the /tmp/.X11-unix folder needs to be deleted and it will work, or just reboot.
• Extension window adding and editing fixed to display better and correctly when it comes to quotes and backslashes.
• Option to emulate 3 button mouse added to Wineskin.app Options. It used to always be on.  This will allow fixes to games that Alt+Click in game didn't work, like Diablo 2.
• Several additions and changes to support WS8 based engines
• WineskinEngine.bundle is no more… everything is in Contents/Frameworks
• WineskinX11 is now part of the wrapper and will be updated/changed with wrapper versions, and is no longer part of the engine.  This means updates to engines bases will be ultra rare, as they will mainly just be a Wine build and nothing more.
• WS8 Engines are Wine versions that should keep 10.5+ compatibility
• WS7 engines are not compatible directly with Wineskin 2.5, however Wineskin Winery 1.3+ will offer to convert your WS7 engines to WS8 engines when it starts up.  This will save you from having to download new engines for the same old Wine versions.
• Option in Wineskin.app to have all but 1 CPU Core disabled while running.  This will affect your whole system, but some old games only work right with 1 CPU.
• Update Wrapper fixed to work with new structure.  If you are trying to update a 2.0 to 2.4 wrapper, you need to do an update, then do the update again and tell it to Force the update when asked.
• There is a WineskinMenuScripts folder in the wrapper with a help.txt file explaining about how to set them up.  This allows you to add custom menu entires to the top drop down menus of a running wrapper.
• Major overhaul to the Winetricks interface done by Syao (Thanks Syao!).  Can search for packages, do multiple packages, do custom runs, and all types of great things now.
• Will prompt an error message if you try to run a wrapper from a Read-Only volume.
• Decorate windows will be on by default now.  Many fullscreen games that didn't work with this option will now work.  For some you may still need to try disabling it.

Release 2.4 - 07/26/2011
• Mapping user folders is much more customizable now
• Fixed the but where Override->Fullscreen pushed the picture down slightly
• Option added to set "Focus Follows Mouse" for WineskinX11, instead of always being on

Release 2.3 - 05/31/2011
• File associations are fixed, including just running a .exe straight from Finder
• Custom Engines should now work fine using any name you want to use
• Confirm quit dialog option available
• The default Menubar name should now be the original wrapper name when its created instead of just "Wineskin Wrapper"
• The Wrapper version and current engine being used show up as text on the Wineskin.app Advanced window

Release 2.2
• Option to add GPU info automatically to Wine registry on run.
• Custom EXE Launchers should have Icons again.
• Making links in user folder to OSX User folders is now optional.
• Winetricks updated, an GUI update button should now work again for Winetricks that may have non-utf-8 encoding.

Release 2.1
•All OSX 10.7 Lion (preview version) bugs found and fixed
•Winetricks now works with spaces in the path ok.
•Winetricks has an added cancel button
•Wineskin.app has an option to change wether Alt/Opt works as an Alt key for the Windows program, or an Option key for the Mac side.
•Multiple wrappers running will no longer fight each other over gamma
•A single wrapper can run from /Applications for any user on the machine. Updated 2.0 to 2.1 wrappers may have issues still, you may want to make a new wrapper.
•Wineskin.app has a new commands blank where you can enter custom commands (like setting variables) that will run along with Wine.
•Engines changes should no longer prompt about Gecko
•Refresh wrapper will no longer load in Wineskin default registry entries.
•Wineskin ICE (Installable Compressed Engine) support added in, and a single first ICE engine is released (WS7Wine1.2.2ICE).  The engine installs locally to your machine automatically, and all wrappers that use the same ICE version will use the same installed version.  This is useful if you have many wrappers that all can use the same ICE version, as it will end up saving a lot of hard drive space.
